## Abstract
Scene synthesis and editing has emerged as a promising direction in computer graphics. Current trained approaches for 3D indoor scenes either oversimplify object semantics through one-hot class encodings (e.g., 'chair' or 'table'), require masked diffusion for editing, ignore room boundaries, or rely on floor plan renderings that fail to capture complex layouts. LLM-based methods enable richer semantics via natural language (e.g., `modern studio with light wood furniture'), but lack editing functionality, are limited to rectangular layouts, or rely on weak spatial reasoning from implicit world models. We introduce **ReSpace**, a generative framework for text-driven 3D indoor scene synthesis and editing using autoregressive language models. Our approach features a compact structured scene representation with explicit room boundaries  that enables asset-agnostic deployment and frames scene editing as a next-token prediction task. We leverage a dual-stage training approach combining supervised fine-tuning and preference alignment, enabling a specially trained language model for object addition that accounts for user instructions, spatial geometry, object semantics, and scene-level composition. For scene editing, we employ a zero-shot LLM to handle object removal and prompts for addition. We further introduce a voxelization-based evaluation capturing fine-grained geometry beyond 3D bounding boxes. Experimental results surpass state-of-the-art on addition and achieve superior human-perceived quality on full scene synthesis.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Text-Driven Editing**: Add, remove, and swap objects via natural language instructions
- **Structured Scene Representation (SSR)**: Lightweight JSON-based format with explicit room boundaries and natural language object descriptions
- **Specialized SG-LLM**: Language model trained specifically for 3D spatial reasoning and object placement  
- **Preference Alignment**: GRPO training with reward function involving geometric and semantic constraints
- **Voxelization-Based Loss**: Fine-grained evaluation beyond 3D bounding boxes

## ReSpace: Framework Overview

We introduce a novel text-driven framework for autoregressive 3D indoor scene synthesis, completion, and editing—supporting object addition, removal, and swapping via natural language prompts. More details can be found on the project website and the paper.

## 📦 Installation

First, clone this repo to get the source code and install the necessary pip packages. The commands below are tested on a system with Python 3.9 and CUDA 12.2. You might need to adapt the package dependencies for your own environment.

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GradientSpaces/respace.git
cd respace

# create conda environment
conda create -n respace python=3.9 -y
conda activate respace

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
conda install cudnn=9 -c conda-forge -y
conda install nccl -c conda-forge -y
```
Next, you will need to download the 3D-FUTURE asset catalog from Alibaba <a href="https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/98063">here</a>. You will need to click on the orange "Apply for dataset" button, create an account, and await approval before you can download the .zip files that contain the 3D assets from the catalog. You will need these meshes for the sampling engine later. After you have a single root folder that contains all asset folders, you need to provide the path to this folder in the ```.env``` file via ```PTH_3DFUTURE_ASSETS=...```. You will need to do the same for the 3D-FRONT dataset <a href="https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/65347">here</a> and provide the path in the same ```.env``` file via ```PTH_3DFRONT_SCENES=...```.

After providing the paths for the two folders, you will need to run our preprocessing script to obtain scaled assets from the original 3D-FUTURE. Our method does not work directly with scaling properties as part of the SSR and assumes scaled assets as input/output, resembling more real-world use-cases where we can't scale assets arbitrarily. For this, you need to make sure the path under ```PTH_3DFUTURE_ASSETS``` is set, then convert all assets into GLB format and scale them:

```bash
python ./src/preprocessing/3d-front/01_convert_assets_obj_glb.py
python ./src/preprocessing/3d-front/scale_assets.py
```

Finally, we need to pre-compute and cache the embeddings and size properties for the asset calog so the sampling engine can work with this cache. You can use an existing version of this cache, assuming no modification to the asset catalog has been taken. The file is available here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T-4cwzNrR2MAAPyxsHrcNhNHh4HXc4vY/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T-4cwzNrR2MAAPyxsHrcNhNHh4HXc4vY/view?usp=sharing</a>. Make sure the file is located under ```./data/metadata/model_info_3dfuture_assets_embeds.pickle``` and is ~174MB. If you want to run the cache compilation from scratch, you can run:

```bash
python ./src/preprocessing/3d-front/06_compute_embeds.py
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Init ReSpace Module
```python
from src.respace import ReSpace
from pathlib import Path
import json

# init respace module
# if you run this command for the first time, it will download model checkpoints for respace-sg-llm-1.5b and llama-3.1-8b via huggingface
# those will be cached and loading this module for subsequent runs will be much faster
respace = ReSpace()

# load existing scene in SSR via JSON as python dictionary
scene = json.loads('{"room_type": "bedroom", "bounds_top": [[- ...')

# for the rendering examples below, we assume that every object has a corresponding asset via sampled_jid
# if not, you can use the sampling engine for asset selection (see section 5 below)

# create rendering (single frame)
# will create renderings with name '<filename>.jpg' inside pth_viz_output
# diagonal perspective in 'diag' folder and top-down in 'top' folder
# requires sampled assets in order to visualize mesh (see asset sampling engine below on how to sample/resample assets)
respace.render_scene_frame(scene, filename="frame", pth_viz_output=Path("./eval/viz/misc/test-june"))

# create rendering (360° rotating video)
respace.render_scene_360video(scene, filename="video-360", pth_viz_output="./eval/viz/misc/test-june")
```

### 2. Object Addition
```python
scene = ...

updated_scene, is_success = respace.handle_prompt("add modern wooden wardrobe", scene)

# you can also use add_object if you want to skip command decomposition via zero-shot LLM (and directly go via SG-LLM)
updated_scene, is_success = respace.add_object("add modern wooden wardrobe", scene)
```

### 3. Full Scene Generation
```python
# full scene generation (unconditional; no floor plan provided)
new_scene, is_success = respace.handle_prompt("create bedroom with 8 objects")
```

### 4. Scene Editing
```python
scene = ...

# remove objects via handle_prompt
edited_scene, is_success = respace.handle_prompt("remove old wooden chair", scene)

# or directly via removal command
edited_scene, is_success = respace.remove_object("old wooden chair", scene)

# swap objects via one single text command
edited_scene, is_success = respace.handle_prompt("swap black couch with modern bookshelf", scene)
```

### 5. Asset Sampling
```python
scene = ...

# resample asset of very last object (greedy sampling)
scene_alt = respace.resample_last_asset(scene, is_greedy_sampling=True)

# resample asset of very last object (true stochastic sampling)
scene_alt = respace.resample_last_asset(scene, is_greedy_sampling=False)

# resample all objects
scene_alt = respace.resample_all_assets(scene, is_greedy_sampling=True)
```

# access all samples from train (all 3 splits)
train_data = dataset["train"]

# get only train samples from bedroom dataset
bedroom_train = train_data.filter(lambda x: "bedroom_train" in x["splits"])

# get only val samples from all split
all_val = val_data.filter(lambda x: "all_val" in x["splits"])

# get props of sample
sample = all_val[0]
print(f"Room type: {sample['room_type']}")
print(f"Number of objects: {sample['n_objects']}")
print(f"Scene: {sample['scene']}")
